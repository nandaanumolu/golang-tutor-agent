# Golang Tutor Agent

This project contains an AI agent built with the ADK (Agent Development Kit) designed to help users learn the Go programming language.

## Description

The agent is configured to act as a friendly and knowledgeable Golang tutor. It can:
- Explain complex topics in simple terms.
- Provide complete, runnable code examples.
- Answer questions about syntax and best practices.
- Help debug small code snippets.

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Start the Agent:**
    The `runner.py` file is the entry point for running the agent. You can run it directly to confirm it's set up correctly.
    ```bash
    python runner.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the Agent (using ADK CLI):**
    Once the ADK CLI is available, you will be able to interact with your agent through a command-line interface for testing and development.
